# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

 # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
 assets:
  - .env
  - assets/images/
  - assets/icon/
 # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
 # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
 # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
 # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
 # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
 # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
 # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
 # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
 # example:
 fonts:
  - family: SharpGrotesk
    fonts:
     - asset: fonts/SharpGrotesk-Medium20.otf
       style: normal
  - family: Nunito
    fonts:
     - asset: fonts/Nunito-Regular.ttf
       style: normal
 #   - family: Trajan Pro
 #     fonts:
 #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
 #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
 #         weight: 700
 #
 # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
